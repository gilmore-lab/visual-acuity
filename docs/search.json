These are prohibited in a document submitted to NIH. Since this document is not part of an NIH study, we provide them here for transparency.\n\nIf any of the proposed research in the application involves the generation of scientific data, this application is subject to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing and requires submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan. If the proposed research in the application will generate large-scale genomic data, the Genomic Data Sharing Policy also applies and should be addressed in this Plan. Refer to the detailed instructions in the application guide for developing this plan as well as to additional guidance on https://sharing.nih.gov. The Plan is recommended not to exceed two pages. Text in italics should be deleted. There is no “form page” for the Data Management and Sharing Plan. The DMS Plan may be provided in the format shown below.\nPublic reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 2 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering, and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
