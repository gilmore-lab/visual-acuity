# Objectives

## Study Objectives

::: {.instr_box .rmdnote}

Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives.

:::

The purpose of this study is to capture and describe the state of knowledge about how visual acuity, as measured by the Teller Acuity Card procedure, develops in children.
Our specific aims are as follows:

1. Survey the published literature on the use of Teller Acuity Cards (TAC) and capture the main effects found in that literature in an open database that will be shared with the research community for meta-analyses and related scholarship.</br>
2. Create and share openly a database of individual participant-level TAC data contributed by authors of published and unpublished research using the TAC. The combined data would eliminate all personally identifying information but would select, curate, organize and share other data about individual participant differences that may be useful for future research, such as participant ethnicity, sex/gender, clinical condition, geographic region (no smaller than county), etc. 

## Primary Study Endpoints

::: {.instr_box .rmdnote}

State the primary endpoints to be measured in the study.

Research typically has a primary objective or endpoint. 
Additional objectives and endpoints are secondary. 
The endpoints (or outcomes), determined for each study subject, are the quantitative measurements required by the objectives. 
Measuring the selected endpoints is the goal of a trial (examples: response rate and survival).

:::

The primary study endpoints are as follows:

1. The creation and publication of the study-level dataset.</br>
2. The creation and publication of the participant-level dataset.

## Secondary Study Endpoints

::: {.instr_box .rmdnote}

State the secondary endpoints to be measured in the study.

:::

Not applicable.

<!--chapter:end:01-objectives.Rmd-->

# Background

## Scientific Background and Gaps

::: {.instr_box}

Describe the scientific background and gaps in current knowledge.
For clinical research studies being conducted at Penn State
Health/Penn State College of Medicine, and for other non-PSH locations
as applicable, describe the treatment/procedure that is considered
standard of care (i.e., indicate how patients would be treated in
non-investigational setting); and if applicable, indicate if the study
procedure is available to patient without taking part in the study.

:::
 
The Teller Acuity Card (TAC) procedure is a non-invasive technique for measuring a form of visual acuity in non-verbal participants, especially human infants and young children [@Teller1983-br].
The TAC is one of the most widely used measures of visual acuity.
A Google Scholar search[^2] for the term "teller acuity cards" on 2023-04-17 yielded more than 6,000 results.
And yet, to our knowledge, there is no single database of TAC results that is available to the research community.

[^2]: URL: <https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=1&q=teller+acuity+cards&hl=en&as_sdt=0,39>
 
## Previous Data

::: {.instr_box}

Describe any relevant preliminary data.

:::

Rick Gilmore has collected TAC data in his research on visual development in infants and children.
In looking through our records, we have found TAC data from some X children tested between X and X as part of a separate series of studies on motion perception.

## Study Rationale

::: {.instr_box}

Provide the scientific rationale for the research.

:::

The widespread use of a similar measurement across diverse populations represents a unique scientific opportunity to capture what is known about a fundamental property of human vision: How precisely can children see high contrast details at different ages?

<!--chapter:end:02-background.Rmd-->

# Data Management and Sharing Plan {#data-mgmt-plan -}

::: {.rmdnote}

The following was updated on 2023-03-01. It is based on document OMB No. 0925-0001 and 0925-0002 (Rev. 07/2022 Approved Through TBD).

Note that the following contains some URLs provided by the user. These are prohibited in a document submitted to NIH. Since this document is not part of an NIH study, we provide them here for transparency.

:::

*If any of the proposed research in the application involves the generation of scientific data, this application is subject to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing and requires submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan.  If the proposed research in the application will generate large-scale genomic data, the Genomic Data Sharing Policy also applies and should be addressed in this Plan.  Refer to the detailed instructions in the application guide for developing this plan as well as to additional guidance on <https://sharing.nih.gov>.  The Plan is recommended not to exceed two pages.  Text in italics should be deleted. There is no “form page” for the Data Management and Sharing Plan. The DMS Plan may be provided in the format shown below.*

*Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 2 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering, and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to: NIH, Project Clearance Branch, 6705 Rockledge Drive, MSC 7974, Bethesda, MD 20892-7974, ATTN: PRA (0925-0001 and 0925-0002). Do not return the completed form to this address.*

## Element 1: Data Type {-}

### A. Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project: {-}

*Summarize the types and estimated amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project.*


### B. Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so: {-}

*Describe which scientific data from the project will be preserved and shared and provide the rationale for this decision.*

### C. Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation: {-}

*Briefly list the metadata, other relevant data, and any associated documentation (e.g., study protocols and data collection instruments) that will be made accessible to facilitate interpretation of the scientific data.*

The full protocol, including survey questions is shared publicly via a website on the code/documentation sharing website, GitHub.

## Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code: {-}

*State whether specialized tools, software, and/or code are needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data, and if so, provide the name(s) of the needed tool(s) and software and specify how they can be accessed.*


## Element 3: Standards {-}

*State what common data standards will be applied to the scientific data and associated metadata to enable interoperability of datasets and resources, and provide the name(s) of the data standards that will be applied and describe how these data standards will be applied to the scientific data generated by the research proposed in this project.  If applicable, indicate that no consensus standards exist.*

There are no consensus standards that apply to these data to our knowledge. However, our publicly shared data cleaning code documents that ways that we modified the original dataset to make it more human-readable. CSV text files are considered to be interoperable.

## Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines {-}

### A. Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:  {-}

*Provide the name of the repository(ies) where scientific data and metadata arising from the project will be archived; see [Selecting a Data Repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository).*

When the project is complete and we receive permission to do so, the data may be archived on Databrary (<https://databrary.org>). Metadata and summary data/visualizations will be archived on GitHub, <https://gilmore-lab.github.io/visual-acuity/>.

### B. How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:  {-}

*Describe how the scientific data will be findable and identifiable, i.e., via a persistent unique identifier or other standard indexing tools.*

If the project data are shared publicly, Databrary will create a persistent identifier (e.g., DOI).

### C. When and how long the scientific data will be made available: {-}

*Describe when the scientific data will be made available to other users (i.e., no later than time of an associated publication or end of the performance period, whichever comes first) and for how long data will be available.*


## Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations: {-}

### A. Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data: {-}

*NIH expects that in drafting Plans, researchers maximize the appropriate sharing of scientific data. Describe and justify any applicable factors or data use limitations affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data related to informed consent, privacy and confidentiality protections, and any other considerations that may limit the extent of data sharing. See [Frequently Asked Questions](https://sharing.nih.gov/faqs#/data-management-and-sharing-policy.htm) for examples of justifiable reasons for limiting sharing of data.*

### B. Whether access to scientific data will be controlled: {-}

*State whether access to the scientific data will be controlled (i.e., made available by a data repository only after approval).*

Databrary does not approve data shared by researchers. Authorization to upload and share data is governed by a formal [Databrary Access Agreement](https://databrary.org/about/agreement.html) that binds Databrary and New York University with a researcher's home institution. The DAA gives institutionally authorized researchers the right to share data and materials with Databrary consistent with the policies of their institution, ethics board approvals, and the permission of research participants. Similarly, while researchers can share data on Databrary and control or approve individual access themselves, Databrary does not require it. 

Once shared, data from this project will be available to anyone.

### C. Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants: {-}

*If generating scientific data derived from humans, describe how the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants will be protected (e.g., through de-identification, Certificates of Confidentiality, and other protective measures).*

## Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing: {-}

*Describe how compliance with this Plan will be monitored and managed, frequency of oversight, and by whom at your institution (e.g., titles, roles).*

The PIs on the project will manage these provisions.
