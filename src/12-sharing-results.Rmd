# Sharing Results with Subjects

::: {.instr_box}

Describe whether results (study results or individual subject results, such as results of investigational diagnostic tests, genetic tests, or incidental findings) will be shared with subjects or others (e.g., the subject's primary care physicians) and if so, describe how information will be shared.

:::

No results will be shared with research participants directly.
However, we will share fully study-level, and participant-level datasets publicly and will announce the datasets availability in scientific publications.
